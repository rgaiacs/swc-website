On 14 February 2018 at 18:00UTC+0,
the Lesson Infrastructure Subcommittee had their 2018 February meeting.
This post will cover the topics discussed and their resolutions.

## Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry merge

Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry had merge.
Their [Executive Council was elected](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/12/executive-council-2018.html),
they have a [new fiscal sponsor](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2018/01/fiscal-sponsor-transition.html)
and
a [new logo](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2018/02/our-new-logo.html).
Also,
they have [hired Dr. François Michonneau](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/curriculum-dev-scaling/) to lead curriculum development efforts.

This all are very exciting news. And we even didn't finished February.

## Windows Installer

We will proceed to adopt Git for Windows v2.15.1,
which includes nano,
and drop our Windows installer.
This should simplify our installation instructions
and
provide a better experience for our learners during the workshop.
All the details of this changes are covered in [this document](https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-infrastructure/blob/master/liep/001-git-for-windows-nano.md)
that summarise many pull requests and issues over the last 6 months.

## Workshop Installation Instructions

In January,
a [blog post was published](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2018/01/proposal-workshop-template.html)
with a proposal to enhancement the process to customize the installation instructions at the workshop page.
After a initial round of feedback,
Raniere Silva,
François Michonneau
and
Rémi Emonet
will move the proof of concept included in the proposal forward to a feasibility prototype.
The plan is to have the prototype ready in April
and,
if we decide to go forward,
made it available to instructors in July
so workshops in August could benefit for this.

## Lesson Release 2018/01

Christina Koch (for Software Carpentry)
and Erin Becker (for Data Carpentry)
will coordinate the next Lesson Release,
planned for the middle of the year.


## Maintainer survey on template

As [announced on the Maintainers mailing list](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/maintainers/2018-February/000453.html),
François Michonneau is running a survey around our lesson template.
We should hear the results soon.

## Labels and Lessons

If you don't know,
[GitHub rolled out some improvements to labels](https://github.com/blog/2505-label-improvements-emoji-descriptions-and-more).
This changes couldn't be in a better time.
Erin Becker
and
François Michonneau
are working to revamp the labels used in the Git repositories that host the lessons.
The new set of labels will facilitate for instructors and learners to navigate on issues and pull requests.

## Next steps

The subcommittee will meet again in April to provide an update on some of the topics covered by this post
and discuss new requests from the community.
